The same should be done on Helm charts in the chart repos post release,but the versions there shouldnâ€™t include a -dev suffix because chart publishing requires that every new chart version be unique and using un-suffixed SemVer is a better release numbering pattern.

If a repository is branched the .gitreview file needs to be changed, adding defaultorigin=voltha-X.Y at the end.
