During the TST meeting yesterday we decided that my current bug fix of JIRA https://jira.opencord.org/browse/VOL-4887 should still be in the 2.11 release.
The related patches in BBSIM and ONU adapter made it to Git, but not into DockerHub.
Can you please take a look into the jobs below that went wrong?
